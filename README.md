# Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) Clone Website Project

Welcome to my HTML and CSS project that aims to create a clone of the Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) website. This project is a practical implementation of my learnings in HTML and CSS.
<br>

## Project Overview

- This project represents a culmination of my HTML and CSS knowledge, serving as a practical implementation of the concepts I've learned. While the current version demonstrates a functional clone of the Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) website, it is designed with scalability in mind, offering ample opportunities for future enhancements and refinements.

- The primary goals of this project include:

  1. Learning Implementation: The project serves as a hands-on application of HTML and CSS concepts, showcasing my ability to translate theoretical knowledge into a tangible web development project.

  2. Scope for Upgradation: With a foundation in place, the project is open to further development and improvement. Future iterations could involve the integration of dynamic content, enhanced user interactivity, or the incorporation of additional technologies.
